# PayRequest Web

### PayRequest (PayStrax) Web App Demo

PayRequest is an e-invoicing engine to send and get paid in crypto.

## Inspiration

We wanted to build something that users can use to send and get paid in Cryptocurrencies, and also tracks financial data. Not just limited to that but reduce human errors while sending tokens and typing wallet addresses.

## Blockchain In Use

We have used smart contracts to send payments with tracking every record using a smart contract. We have also used the off-chain database to query the dataset. (Sending every request to the blockchain would be expensive)

## Configuration

- ASP.NET Core 2.2 SDK
- MSSQL server 
- Visual Studio 2017
- Strati Blockchain 

## Frontend

## Backend

- ASP.NET Core API

## Database Script

Run database script to create require schema and user data. We have default users as below:

```
User 1
Email: roger@gmail.com
Password: Admin

User 2
Email: cz@gmail.com
Password: Admin

User 3
Email: justin@gmail.com
Password: Admin
```
